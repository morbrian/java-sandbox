## About the Tests

The code demonstrates some simple list processing using standard for loops,
and compares the performance to using the java paralell capabilities.
The results are mostly to satisfy my curiosity for these isolated use cases, 
and probably do not tell us much about the more general use of this strategy
for other pusposes.
